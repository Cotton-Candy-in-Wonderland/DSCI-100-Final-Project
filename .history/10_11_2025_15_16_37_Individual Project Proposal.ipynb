    "In this project we will be tasked with analyzing a data set in collaboration with a research science group at UBC. Spearheaded by Frank Wood and his team, this project aims to provide insights to the relationships between online gaming and its users, highlighting often arbitrary forms of data, such as newsletter subscription, time logged in, and types of players. Through the use of different classification techniques and data recorded from a Minecraft server, we can then make conclusions for more efficient and targeted outreach to players.\n",

    "Some potential issues that arise when dealing with the data are: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1:** The data in itself is not tidy, specifically the `sessions.csv` data set, and must be wrangled for simplicity and ease of understandability. For example, the variables of `original_start_time` and `original_end_time` are displayed in the Unix timestamp converter. Furthermore, there are multiple measurements in the columns of `start_time` and `end_time`, which does not adhere to the rule of tidy data - \"each column must have a single variable\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**2:** Since my research question mainly deals with the `players.csv` data set and is focused experience and hours played, I will not be using the `name` or `gender` variable. "

    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will be tasked with analyzing a data set in collaboration with a research science group at UBC. Spearheaded by Frank Wood and his team, this project aims to provide insights to the relationships between online gaming and its users, highlighting often arbitrary forms of data, such as newsletter subscription, time logged in, and types of players. Through the use of different classification techniques and data recorded from a Minecraft server, we can then make conclusions for more efficient and targeted outreach to players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broad question that we will be aiming to tackle in my project is **What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?** \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, **Can we predict a player's chance to subscribe to the newsletter based on their total hours played, experience, and age?** In order to answer these questions, multiple steps must be taken to wrangle the data and carry out our predictions. More on this will be discussed later. "

For example, the variables of `original_start_time` and `original_end_time` are displayed in the Unix timestamp converter. Furthermore, there are multiple measurements in the columns of `start_time` and `end_time`, which does not adhere to the rule of tidy data - \"each column must have a single variable\".\n",
